# -A-FOREST-FIRE-IDENTIFICATION-METHOD-FOR-UNMANNED-AERIAL-VEHICLE-MONITORING-VIDEO-IMAGES
## Project Overview
This project presents an automated forest fire identification system using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) monitoring video images. The system leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect fire and smoke in real-time aerial video streams, enabling early forest fire detection, faster response, and reduced environmental damage.UAV-based monitoring provides a cost-effective and scalable solution compared to traditional ground-based or satellite fire detection systems.
## Objectives
-Detect forest fires and smoke from UAV video footage
-Enable early warning systems for disaster management
-Reduce false alarms using intelligent AI-based classification
-Support real-time monitoring in remote and inaccessible forest areas
## Technologies Used
-Python
-OpenCV
-Deep Learning (CNN / YOLO / ResNet – configurable)
-TensorFlow / PyTorch
-UAV Video Streams
-Image Processing Techniques
## System Workflow
-UAV captures real-time forest video footage
-Video frames are extracted and preprocessed
-AI model detects fire and smoke patterns
-Detected regions are highlighted with bounding boxes
-Alerts are generated for emergency response teams
## Responsibilities
